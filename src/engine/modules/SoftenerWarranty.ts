/**
 * SoftenerWarranty
 *
 * Models the Worcester Bosch "Softener Edge":
 *
 *  - WB Greenstar 8000+ (Al-Si) is uniquely compatible with artificially
 *    softened water on the domestic (DHW) side of the secondary circuit.
 *    This removes the 11% "DHW Scaling Tax" in hard/very_hard water zones.
 *
 *  - PRIMARY BYPASS RULE: The heating circuit must still be filled with hard
 *    water + Sentinel X100 inhibitor to satisfy WB warranty conditions.
 *    A bypass valve must be installed to prevent softened water from reaching
 *    the primary loop.
 *
 *  - Vaillant and most other manufacturers do NOT support artificially softened
 *    water in the primary circuit.
 *
 * Commercial value: Justifies the premium WB 8000+ specification over competitors
 * in hard/very_hard postcodes where a softener is fitted or planned.
